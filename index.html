                                        <p>Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store, retrieve, transmit,
                                                and manipulate data, or information, often in the context of a business or
                                                other enterprise. IT is considered to be a subset of information and communications
                                                technology (ICT). The term is commonly used as a synonym for computers and
                                                computer networks, but it also encompasses other information distribution
                                                technologies such as television and telephones. Several products or services
                                                within an economy are associated with information technology.</p>

                                                soon, as most companies are switching to recurring revenue models. Already,
                                                you can order your clothing, groceries and cleaning supplies to be delivered
                                                directly to your doorstep on a weekly or monthly basis. The subscription
                                                business model is a business model where a customer must pay a subscription
                                                price to have access to a product or service. The model was pioneered by
                                                magazines and newspapers, but is now used by many businesses and websites.
